Group 14 Tv Show Project

Our target browser is Google Chrome. We didn't a mobile version of the site.

We used a TV Show API: https://www.tvmaze.com/api#show-main-information

Our project uses visualize the ratings of the TV shows from our API by using
bar charts we created using D3.

We didn't use any CSS frameworks.

Our site is designed to help users decide what shows to watch based off of
their mood. It also visualizes what shows of certain genres are most popular, to
help users get an idea of where to start.
